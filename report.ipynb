They have provided our class with some data and 3 broad questions to help them understand which players to target for recruitment. For our project, we aim to answer the following question:\n",

    "> Question 1: What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
